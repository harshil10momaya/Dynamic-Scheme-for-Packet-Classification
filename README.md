# Dynamic-Scheme-for-Packet-Classification
Binary Packet Classifier: A Splay Tree Approach
This project implements a dynamic packet classification system using Splay Trees, designed to efficiently categorize network packets based on predefined source and destination filters. The system features a user-friendly menu-driven interface that enables real-time packet classification, search operations, and traversal of the Splay Tree data structure. By converting binary string inputs into integer values, the system identifies matching filters and updates the tree structure to enhance future searches through the splay operation.

Key Features:

•	Dynamic Packet Classification: The system allows users to input source and destination packets in binary format, efficiently classifying them against a set of predefined filters.

•	Splay Tree Data Structure: Utilizes Splay Trees for dynamic data management, ensuring quick access and modification through splay operations.
Potential Improvements:

•	Incorporate visualization tools to graphically represent the Splay Tree structure.

•	Expand filter capabilities to include more complex filtering criteria and statistics on packet flows.
This project serves as an educational tool, demonstrating the application of advanced data structures in network packet classification and offering practical insights into efficient data management in real-time applications.
